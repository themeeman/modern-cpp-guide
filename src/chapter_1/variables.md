# Variables

Variables are names that represent values in the program. They can be declared with the `auto` keyword.

```cpp
int main() {
    auto x = 1; // Creates a variable called x with the value 1
    std::cout << x << '\n';
    x = 2; // Reassigns it to the value 2
    std::cout << x << '\n';
}
```

Note that by default, variables are auto
