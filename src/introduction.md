# Introduction

Hello and welcome to this book. This book is meant as a guide for navigating modern C++ practices, using the latest version of C++, C++20.

## Who is this book for?

I am writing this book for intermediate level programmers who have already got to grips with a different language, so they already have some basic programming concepts under their belt.
